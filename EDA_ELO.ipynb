    "One peculiar instance is that the `VISSP_NO` variable all came out to 1 even though there are no plant species or visitor species identified. We are going to remove these data from the dataset to remove any outliers, however, this takes out a very large chunk from out sample. Not only is the total removed come out to being ~19% of our data, but it removes over 60% of the observations from 2014, 2015, and 25% of the data from 2016 as seen in the histogram below. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, while we are not given any of the species information for any of the plants or visitors, we believe that we should keep the data because it indicates that there **was** a pollinator-plant interaction. Our assumption here is that the researcher that went out on this particular day did not know the species of the bug or the plant and simply made a count without being able to dictate what species it was. However, this is still a count of an interaction."
