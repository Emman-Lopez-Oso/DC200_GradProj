    "# Data Sampling and Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "## How was the data collected?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our group is utilizing the `plant_pollinator_diversity_set1.csv` that contains ecological data collected from a long-term observation study from 2011 to 2018 that focuses on plant-pollinator interaction and its impact on local biodiversity. The data is from an annual collection of plant-pollinator interaction data from 15 minute plot watches in Montane Meadows in Oregon. The data was collected through June to September of each year. Thus, data from late-fall to spring is unavailable for each year. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling plots, along with other tools like transects and point method, are tools used for field observations to collect ecological data. The goal is to get unbiased samples of a sufficient quantity that statistical analyses will be sounder.\n",
    "\n",
    "An ecologist made observations for 15 minutes at one specific plot indicated by the the `PLOT_ID` in addition to other plots on that same day. The chronological period in which a survey took place is indicated by the `WATCH` variable. Various weather conditions were reported such as `CLOUDS`, `WIND`, and `TEMP` during the observations. Pollinator, plant and interaction (`PLTSP_NAME`, `VISSP_NAME`, `NO_INT`) data are also observation-based variables. Thus, the data was collected exclusively by human observations in a given 15 min window during the months of June and September from 2011 to 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Was there any potential bias introduced in the sampling process?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Biologist/Ecologist Fatigue: The observer may have less precision in accurately documenting all the potential plants and pollinators for an extended period of time. Therefore, observations that occured later in the day might have less accurate data.\n",
    "2. Biologist/Ecologist Accuracy: The biologist/ecologist who took these samples may have not been as well trained as others. Also, reliance on senior staff may also hinder correct identification. For example, a more junior researcher may have to consult a supervisor if that researcher is unable to determine the species. The supervisor may or may not consult a field guide and depend on touch, feel and personal knowledge to identify a particular species. This may lead to misidentification and misrepresentation of the data. \n",
    "3. Human Error: Similar to what was stated above, human error can occur in misidentification as well as other observation processes. In the instance of collecting the temperature data, a third of the observation have null values. Thus, some of the data wasn't collected based on the inability for the Biologist/Ecologist to determine the correct value (i.e. temperature).\n",
    "4. The data does not encompass the spring season. Thus, there are interactions that are not recorded during that time."
